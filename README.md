#  Kwest App POC

Simple application that shows a list of quests retrieved from API. Each quest has a list of venues and is being shown on the map.

- Test application that explores the use of MVVM
- Shows usage of implementing UI in storyboard, XIB files and creation programmatically
- Shows the capability to make network request and parse the data received back through new Codable protocol and use of Generics. Connects to mock json server that provides the data
- Couple of UI customizations such as image view parallax, colors, custom map annotation views and explored the use of a bottom sheet overlay similar to MapKit
- Demonstates use of pod Kingfisher for loading the images from the webresource

## Backlog
- Bottom sheet is simple implementation. Can be improved by including bounce effect and ability to scroll up even when touch point is on the tableview
- Handle location authorization updates
- Additional features can be added like ability for a checklist and saving user information
